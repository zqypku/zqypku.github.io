This is Ziqing Yang, a third-year PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), co-advised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/).
My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, with a particular interest in exploring the security and safety risks in generative AIs and agents. 

Before that, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/).
Advised by [Prof. Ming Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LbzoQBsAAAAJ), I focused on knowledge representation and graph analysis.
During my undergraduate, I was also a research intern at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yizhou Sun](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/), working on the combination of knowledge graphs and logical rules.

### research interests

- Trustworthy machine learning (safety, privacy, and security)
- Generative models and agents
- Graph analysis
